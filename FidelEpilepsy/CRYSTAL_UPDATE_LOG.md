# Crystal Glass UI Update Log

## Summary
The UI has been successfully updated from "Medical Cyberpunk" to a **"Novel Crystal Glass"** aesthetic as requested.

## Changes Applied
1.  **Design System (`DesignSystem.swift`)**
    - Repalced neon colors with a refined palette: Crystal Blue, Amber Glass, Ruby Red.
    - Updated backgrounds to use deep gradients instead of flat black.
    - Introduced `.ultraThinMaterial` for true glass effects.

2.  **Components (`Components.swift`)**
    - **Buttons**: Completely redesigned to look like frosted glass with subtle white borders.
    - **Cards**: Removed heavy neon borders; now using soft, translucent surfaces.
    - **Swipe Button**: Updated to a pill-shaped glass slider.

3.  **Views**
    - **Dashboard**: Features a floating "Glass Hero" component and ambient gradient background.
    - **Seizure Phase 1**: Immersive, pulsing gradient background with refined, thin typography.
    - **Seizure Phase 2**: urgency is conveyed through deep red gradients and clear glass instruction cards.

## Next Steps
- Run the app in Xcode Simulator to verify the transparency effects, as they rely on standard iOS blur materials.
